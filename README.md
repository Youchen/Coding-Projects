 	Personal Project - Twitter Search
	 	This project is supported by using API from:
		Apache POI
			https://poi.apache.org
		Twitter4j
			http://twitter4j.org/en/index.html
	
		This program is to get the tweets from the search response on https://twitter.com and
			 parse the response stream by using Twitter4j API, store the data to 2 place:
			- Local database server and
			- the Excel file on hard disk (for the purpose of database backup);
	
		Furthermore, all the images will be saved locally, and the response html will be saved as
			the form of "html_query words - <key word>" locally as well.
